- Support many tools/frameworks, like PostCSS, Sass, Svelte, etc.
- Uses memory cache/file system cache to produce better performance.
- Does not support bundling app for production. We are just focusing on the development build.

## Vite

By the way, Every project is fully featured in its own way. Which project you
want to use depends on what are you building.
